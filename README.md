Steps to perform climate attribution analysis:

1. Download monthly precipitation data into the directory input_data/CMIP6/. Climate model data from the CMIP6 database can be accessed via the Earth System Grid Federation website at https://aims2.llnl.gov/search. See input_data/README.md for details.

2. Run the jupyter notebook 1_climate_attribution.ipynb. This script saves figure files to the /figures/ directory.
