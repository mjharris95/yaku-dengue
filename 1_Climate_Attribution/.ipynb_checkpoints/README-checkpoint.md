Steps to perform climate attribution analysis:

1. Download monthly precipitation data into the directory /input_data/CMIP6/. Climate model data from the CMIP6 database can be accessed via the Earth System Grid Federation website at https://aims2.llnl.gov/search. See /input_data/CMIP6/README.md for details.

2. Run the jupyter notebook /scripts/1_climate_attribution.ipynb. This script saves figure files to the /figures/ and directory.

3. When running /scripts/1_climate_attribution.ipynb, certain steps will require you to run the .sh files contained in the /scripts/ directory from the command line.

Please email Jared Trok (trok@stanford.edu) if you have any questions regarding this analysis code.
